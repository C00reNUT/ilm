We presented a simple strategy for the task of infilling which leverages language models. 
Our approach is capable of infilling sentences which humans have difficulty recognizing as machine-generated. 
Furthermore, 
we demonstrated that our infilling framework is effective when starting from large-scale pre-trained LMs, 
which may be useful in limited data settings. 
In future work, we plan to incorporate these features into co-creation systems which assist humans in the writing process. 
We hope that our work encourages more investigation of infilling, 
which may be a key missing element of current writing assistance tools.
